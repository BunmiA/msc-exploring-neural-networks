# msc-exploring-neural-networks
 This project investigates different neural network archieture for emotion recognition
 
 ### CNNs
 
 The project begins with constructing a neural network as described in https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub42455. 
 
 ### using Pre trained models 
 
It then goes on to use pretrained models got signle frame image classification but taking into account. the Temporal Fusion arecheture discribed in https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub42455. Such as 

* Early fusion 
* Late fusion
* Slow fusion

Below shows the accurancy of the various designs


| Pre-trained model| Early fusion| Late Fusion | Slow Fusion | 
| ------------------|:-----------:| ----------:| -----------:|
|                   |              |           |             |
|                   |              |           |             |
|                   |              |           |             |

 
 ### RNN
 
 
 ### Capsules 
 
 The project also aims to invetigate the capsuleNet archetecure as explained in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829
