    \section{Conclusion}
  From the implementing these models it is clear to see how the tensorflow and keras API truly provide an user friendly and efficient way of implementing these models.
  There is still improvements to be made to made such as a random cropping frunction in the augumentation libary.
  One observations is the superiority of the batch normalization over local response normalization which as discussed \citep{ioffe2015batch}  is set to allow about 14 times fewer training steps.
