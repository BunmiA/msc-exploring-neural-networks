  This paper investigates the design and building of different neural network architectures for video classification using tensorflow and the keras API. It begins by constructing a CNN Neural network architecture as described in \citep{KarpathyCVPR14}, using the keras API and tensorflow packages in python to build the required layer and models. these models where trained using the tensorflow UCF101 dataset. Finally it discusses minor adjustments made on model the performance and problems found with constructing and running these models.
