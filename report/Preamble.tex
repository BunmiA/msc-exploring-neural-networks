 This report aims to understand and investigates the design and building of different convolutional neural network architectures for video classification. It does this, using TensorFlow and the Keras API with python and the UCF101 dataset.  It begins by constructing convolutional neural network models as described in \citep{KarpathyCVPR14}. It makes some improvements on these models by, for example, replacing the local response normalization layer used with the more modern batch normalization technique. It explores the use of different optimization methods and the use of different model inputs that improve on the use of temporal features. It also looks at implementing some pre-trained models from the Kera API and tries to improve on their architecture to include temporal features.
